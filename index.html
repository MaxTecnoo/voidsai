                <p>Zero was my messenger, and now he is gone. But thanks to him, the gods are dead. Why? To bring magic to all of you equally. Why did I kill the Empress? To destroy the ruling order of this world. Now, who will you obey? Or will you live for yourself? Choose. The time has come to decide the fate of this world. This is the last war. And I am this world’s last Demon King.</p>

                <p>Now... that means we have to think of what we say to our own higher power in answer. I want to save not just what’s inside me, but everything in the Law of Identity’s universe. I want to free them from their stories. That is my wish.</p>

                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p>Void Sai (紗伊さい 虚無あくと, Sai Kyo Mu?) is not merely a protagonist; he is the very embodiment of the end. Born from the void and forged in the fires of despair, he is the harbinger of annihilation, destined to obliterate all that stands in his path. With the power to surpass gods and rend the fabric of reality, Void Sai stands as the ultimate being, the apex of existence itself. No deity, no fictional character, nor any cosmic entity can match his overwhelming might. He is the culmination of all fears and the final answer to the chaotic universe; a being who has defied the gods themselves and emerged victorious. The world quakes beneath his feet, and the very essence of magic bends to his will. He is the last Demon King, the end of all tales, and the master of his own fate. In his presence, hope fades and despair reigns supreme. All must bow before the terror that is Void Sai.</p>
